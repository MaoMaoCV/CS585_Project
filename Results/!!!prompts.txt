To give similarity scores between the sentences, you will analyze the key elements of each sentence and compare them across all four sentences. The similarity scores will range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents no similarity and 1 represents identical sentences. Group the three sentences that are most similar, and compare with the other two sentences separately.
