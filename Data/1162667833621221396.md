On a muted brown background, a vibrant orange pumpkin sits to the left, its stem standing tall and proud. Beside it, a "Milka" chocolate bar wrapper showcases a Halloween-themed design. The wrapper is a deep brown color, and prominently displays the brand's logo in white, accentuated by playful orange splashes that seem to resemble melted chocolate or pumpkin puree. Just below the logo, there's a small, cartoonish raccoon wearing a Dracula cape, with a surprised expression on its face. The centerpiece of the design is an illustrated smiling pumpkin with a green twisted stem. The word "PUMPKIN" is written underneath in bold, white letters, suggesting the flavor of the chocolate. In the foreground, several pieces of the chocolate bar are broken off, revealing the signature "Milka" imprint on each square, hinting at the creamy goodness within. The entire setup exudes a festive, autumnal vibe, blending the spirit of Halloween with the indulgence of chocolate.

On a warm, ambient backdrop, a large, luminously carved pumpkin with a classic jack-o'-lantern face dominates the left side. Its deep-set triangular eyes and cheerful crescent mouth glow softly, with its curvaceous stem gently arching upward. Adjacent to this festive gourd is a towering "Milka" chocolate bar wrapper. The wrapper's rich brown hue contrasts beautifully with the vivid orange splashes that evoke liquid chocolate or melted caramel cascading down its length. A prominently displayed "Milka" logo in creamy white sits atop the wrapper, while the word "PUCK" is inscribed below it, surrounded by a splashy, milky graphic, suggesting a special flavor or ingredient. The chocolate bar itself is intricately depicted, showing individual squares each bearing the "Milka" imprint. One square has been separated, revealing a tantalizing, velvety filling inside. Tiny illustrations of pumpkins embellish the wrapper, with two miniature real pumpkins sitting at the base of the scene, providing a whimsical touch. The composition is a harmonious blend of Halloween festivity and chocolatey indulgence.

Set against a moody, dark backdrop, two atmospheric, carved pumpkins flank a towering "Milka" chocolate bar wrapper. Each pumpkin exudes a soft luminescence from its classic jack-o'-lantern face, with one pumpkin on the left showing a slightly tilted, whimsical expression, while its counterpart on the right showcases a more traditional, cheerful demeanor. The chocolate bar wrapper in the center is awash in a vibrant, molten orange hue, reminiscent of melted chocolate or lava, which cascades downwards in a dynamic pattern. The creamy "Milka" logo stands out prominently, with a playful "PUMPKIN" sign and a splashy graphic below, suggesting a special Halloween edition. Floating amidst the molten design are mini jack-o'-lantern faces and a three-dimensional chocolate bar, giving a sense of depth and movement. In front of the wrapper, a large, glossy "Milka" chocolate bar lies partly unwrapped, revealing its velvety interior and individual squares stamped with the "Milka" logo. Several squares are broken off, resting nearby with drips of molten chocolate, completing this delectable and festive scene.
